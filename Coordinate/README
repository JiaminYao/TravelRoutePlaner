Map Coordinate Annotation Tool
This tool allows you to display an image, annotate points by clicking on it, and save the annotated image with the corresponding points. 
It supports both Python and C++ implementations. Python is recommended for ease of use, while C++ provides a performance-oriented alternative.

## Features
- Display an image.
- Mouse interaction for annotating points on the image.

## Requirements
For Python:
- Python 3.6 or later.
- OpenCV (installed via Conda or pip).
- Matplotlib.
For C++:
- C++ Com- piler: g++ with support for C++11 or later.
- OpenCV Library: Installed via Conda or a compatible package manager.

## Installation
1. Install OpenCV (Both Python and C++)
Run the following command in your Conda environment:
```conda install -c conda-forge opencv```

2. Additional Dependencies for Python
Install Matplotlib for Python:
```pip install matplotlib```

## Usage
Python Version
Run the Python program:
```python mapCoordinate.py```

C++ Version
1. Compile the program using the following command (replace xxx with the actual paths to your OpenCV installation):
```g++ -std=c++11 -o mapCoordinate mapCoordinate.cpp -I/xxx/include/opencv4 -L/xxx/lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_imgcodecs```
Example (if using Conda on macOS):
```g++ -std=c++11 -o mapCoordinate mapCoordinate.cpp -I/Users/yaojiamin/miniconda3/include/opencv4 -L/Users/yaojiamin/miniconda3/lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_imgcodecs```

2. Set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the OpenCV libraries (replace xxx with the actual path):
```export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=xxx/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH```
Example (if using Conda on macOS):
```export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/yaojiamin/miniconda3/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH```

3. Run the compiled program:
```./mapCoordinate```


## C++ Troubleshooting
Missing Include or Library Files:
Ensure the include files are present:
```ls /Users/your_username/miniconda3/include/opencv4```
Ensure the library files are present:
```ls /Users/your_username/miniconda3/lib | grep opencv```

"Library not loaded" Error:
Ensure DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly:
```export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/your_username/miniconda3/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH```

Compiler Errors:
Ensure you are using a compiler that supports C++11 or later.
